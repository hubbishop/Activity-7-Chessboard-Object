#### Update the Board class
1. Include the creation of the GUI chessboard in the init method, assign it to self.GUI
2. Update the move method so that it moves the corresponding piece on the board

```
class Board:
  
  def __init__(self):
    self.board = ...
    self.pieces = 
    self.taken = []
    self.GUI = 
    
  def print(self):

  def check_move(self, pos, move):
  
  def move(self, pos, move):
  ```

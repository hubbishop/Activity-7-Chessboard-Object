### Create a Chessboard class. 
1. Use your code from acivity 6 to create the __init__ method.
2. Create a move method which accepts a start position [x,y] and and end position [x, y] and moves the piece at the start
position to the end position. If there is a piece at the end position remove it from the board.
This method does NOT need to check if the move is valid or not, it just does the move on the board.
